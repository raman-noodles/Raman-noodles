    "This example will walk you through the code to initialize the Raman spectral database that all of Raman Noodles anticipates you have, as well as giving you experience with how to add your own custom Raman spectra to the initial database. This is, in short, an example of how to use the `shoyu.py` file, and a walkthrough of all of the various functions therein. Currently, this module only interacts with the NIST database found at https://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/\n",

    "To do this, we need to call the `shoyu.more_please` function. It takes as parameters a CAS number, and optionally it can take a label that you want to assign to the Raman spectra. The CAS number is what is used for the Raman lookup, and can be input either including, or unincluding hyphens. For example, the CAS number for benzaldehyde, a compound which smells like almonds, is **100-52-7**, which can be passed either as **100-52-7** or as **100527**. Both will yield the same result. If no label is passed to the function, it will use the title directly as passed from the NIST website. It will be returned in all-caps, and the future calls will be case-sensitive, so make sure to take note of this. If you choose to pass your own label, you should make sure to carefully consider the case of the label that you pass, such that it is easy to remember.  \n",
