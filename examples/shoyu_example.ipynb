    "\n",
    "This example will walk you through the code to initialize the Raman spectral database that all of Raman Noodles anticipates you have, as well as giving you experience with how to add your own custom Raman spectra to the initial database. This is, in short, an example of how to use the `shoyu.py` file, and a walkthrough of all of the various functions therein. Currently, this module only interacts with the NIST database found at https://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/\n",

It will be returned in all-caps, and the future calls will be case-sensitive, so make sure to take note of this.
